Prepared by Rod Setterlund, President, Nepal Australia Friendship Association (NAFA)

 

Highlights of history and current status of Ri VDC, Dhading rice and roofing tin response

    25 April 2015 - date of 1st earthquake, epi-center at Gorkha, just west of Ri VDC, Dhading district, where NAFA and other like-minded INGO partners have worked together to support a group of villages in health, education and other community infrastructure e.g. water, micro-hydro, improved cooking stoves for over 15 years.

    Circa 30 April - photos begin to be sent out showing devastating damage to the Ri VDC area. 100% of houses were destroyed in the area 82 people killed in that VDC. All infrastructure has also been destroyed by earthquake and subsequent landslides, though some materials have been salvaged.

    5 May 2015 - Ri VDC wide (25 villages) request letter and budget received from the Hilly Region Development Club via Chandra Tamang, requesting 1.5 bundles of roofing tin per household to provide temporary shelter before the onset of the monsoon season and 2 x 30 = 60 kgs of rice for 1,173 households whose home had been destroyed by the earthquake. Following village by village survey the total number was adjusted on 20 May to 2,223 families.

    5-17 May – Campaign to raise funds for immediate response in Ri VDC, coordinated by Chandra Tamang (Hilly Region Development Club) in Kathmandu, Rod Setterlund (NAFA) in Australia, other INGO and private supporters of the area in Australia (Nepalese Association of Queensland), Spain (Smile Back to Me), Austria (Nepaleducaid), France (Namaste Enfant d’Himalayan) and Kuwait (British School).

    12 May – date of 2nd and 3rd large earthquakes in Nepal, epi-center at Namche Bazaar near Everest.

    18 May – contract signed with Hulas steel Industries Limited to manufacture 8 ft long (12 sheets per family = 1.5 bundles) colour bonded (to prevent rust) 28 gauge heavy corrugated iron sheets, with final specifications determined in consultation with community representatives and the manufacturer.

    Final cost per family = 9,325 Nrs (AUD$117), which compared to the list price of that gauge and quality of iron, represents a 24% discount off the list price. Discount negotiated by Chandra due to volume and personal contacts.

    23 May 2015 – Rice ordered: 1,223 families x 2 bags x 30 kgs = 2,020 Nrs (AUD$25.25) per family.

    28 May 2015 – Rod arrived in Kathmandu. Discussed logistics of getting roofing tin and rice to end of road head with Chandra. Chandra contacted 4WD truck owners who indicated they would only be able to transport 1,000 bags of rice x 30 kgs = 3,000 kgs = 3 Ton per load at 23,000 Nrs per truckload. This is far less than the 10 ton capacity of 2 WD trucks driving on the bitumen roads to Dhading.

    We re-calculated the number of trucks needed to be in excess of 50 truckloads for the anticipated 150 ton combined load of the roofing tin and rice. This would increase the cost of transport significantly but also mean that it was very unlikely that we would be able to make it there before the monsoon rains close the road.

    Concluded we needed to try and get transport support from someone. Looked up UN website and eventually got connected to the UN World Food Program’s Logistics Cluster, the area responsible for coordinating support, including road and helicopter transport of goods. Spoke to head of area who offered to meet with us the next day. Chandra and I submitted an online transport assistance request form, then went out to the Cargo area of the airport the following day, where the logistics cluster team is based within the World Food Program.

    After an hour and a half wait met with relevant staff who said support was possible but that it would take about 65 helicopter trips (maybe a week or longer, weather permitting) from Dhading Besi to Tawal (10 minutes each way by helicopter) to transport the 150 ton of roofing tin and rice.

    30 May – 2 June A number of visits to UN Logistics Cluster site at airport. Were told on 2 June that the Mi8 Russian built helicopter they were planning to use was too big to land at the school in Tawal so an alternative site was needed.

    After checking Google earth and with Chandra’s knowledge of the area, agreed on a site at Ladap (Coordinates = N28.05’17.43 E84.59’09.56), where 3 terraces ended up having to be cleared of maize crop and then flattened to give the UN the 50 metres by 50 metres landing site required. Farmers to be compensated for losing their crop and the terrace boundaries. UN agent said they wanted to wait until all the rice (already in Dhading) and roofing tin (at the time still being manufactured) was in Dhading before they would start the airlift.

    The rice already in Dhading and ready to be airlifted.

    1 June Hulas agent agreed to delivery date of Thursday 4 June to Dhading after much negotiation as the demand for roofing tin at this time is very high.

    2 June Manufacture of roofing tin commenced but the wording that Chandra had proposed to acknowledge donors was too long for the stamp they had so we had to drop the idea as we didn’t want to hold up production. Alternatively Chandra organised the printing of a banner and stickers for each bundle of tin, acknowledging the major donors.

    4 June Roofing tin arrives in Dhading but not colour bonded. Manufacturer accepts their paperwork error as colour bonded roofing tin paid for. Agrees to re-manufacture and after many back and forth personal visits to the agent, deliver date of 11 June agreed upon.

    4 June UN Logistics Cluster notified and agrees to separate application for transport assistance, so uplift of rice can proceed from 5 June.

    5 June Boarded UN hired helicopter, accompanied by Avinash Shrestha (Nepalese Association of Queensland), Chandra Tamang and Tuddha Tamang.

    10+ HRDC volunteers were ready at Landing Zone (LZ) in Dhading Besi to load rice and then to Ladap for first delivery of rice.

    6 loads on first day, then public holiday for pilots and crew on Saturday so no flights then varied number of flights from Sunday 7 June, with helicopter again unavailable on Monday 8 June as needing maintenance. Varied number of airlifts due to having to share use of the helicopter with other NGOs

    Other problems needing to be solved along the way include having to change the LZ in Dhading due to excess dust on landing and having to spend 2 hours each day to prepare LZ at Ladap by putting water on it (much by hand via water jugs) to keep the dust down.

    Rod and Avinash in the area for 4 days (see separate report) to assess earthquake damage, talk to local leaders and witness commencement of rice distribution to families.

    7 June Rice distribution commences after Rod and Avinash address local leaders and the first recipients, expressing sadness on behalf of all supporters of area (namely each donor and persons who have visited the area who the villagers know), explaining how funds for the roofing tin and rice response were raised, confirming that donors will stand by villages in the area during the next phase of rebuilding and expressing confidence in the strength, skills and resilience in them to rebuild their lives after such a terrible event.

    Villagers express appreciation with kartas and big smiles for the response and offer to stand by them in their time of need.

    7-10 June Rice distributed to about 70% of families in the VDC (6 of 9 wards= 18 of 25 villages). Each of the 9 wards are taking turns volunteering to unload helicopter and then at the end of the day return to their shelters with their allocation of rice. List of families in each ward maintained by HRDC representatives to keep track of distribution.

    12 June – monsoon rains start in Dhading. Though there are sufficient tarpaulins below and above rice, steam comes up from the ground, enduring 45 bags (2%) inedible. These will need to be replaced, adding 46,000 Nrs (AUD $575) to budgeted costs.

    Additional costs are also being borne at the Landing Zone in Dhading Besi as the roofing tin has to be off-loaded from the larger trucks to smaller 4WD trucks to get across rising river waters. Additional costs at least 200,000 Nrs ($2,500) need to be added to budget.

    15 June – rice distribution to 1,223 families in Ri VDC completed.

    17 June - uplift of roofing tin from Dhading to Ladap started.

    7 July - 80% of uplift of roofing tin completed = 975 out of the 1,223 families

    7 July – 150 villagers stuck after picking up their roofing tin allocation in Ladap (landing zone for uplift) due to ongoing big storms in area.

    8 July – distribution of roofing tin to 1,223 families in Ri VDC completed (yeh!).



Summary: Local villagers are extremely grateful of the assistance that has been provided by the major donors listed below, as well as all the smaller donors not listed. The response was logistically very challenging but we have got there in the end and we should all be very proud of this achievement in helping those in great need at this time. There are uncertain times ahead due to landslide risks but hopefully the next phase will be a rebuilding phase commencing after the monsoon season ends.","Medical Team, Food Security or Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Organization, Shelter Organization, ",28.11558,84.97,,Dhading,,,,,,,,,,KLL,,Jan,,jan@ateliersottomuro.com,YES,NO,Unactionable,NO,NO,YES,,"Rod / Jan, The Assessment cluster has reported a gap in assessments of this area.

Report from disastermedics.org:
&quot;We found out that that village was called giban pui(I think). It has about 98 houses and all have been completely destoyed or damaged to an unlivable condition.  Most every family was able to salvage enough pieces of their old house to build a temporary shelter. Or they moved the animals out of the barn and turned the barn I to a house. We stayed in what was a barn that had been cleaned out and turned into two houses. The nearest medical facility is 2 hrs away. There is a medical sub station. 2 hrs farther down the road or they can go 2 hrs into Kathmandu. No one was seriously hurt in the earthquake in this village. Since most of the people live on the hillside, there is still this possibility of land slides or mud slides happening from an after shock. The primary school has had the lions club come and build temporary class rooms for the student its to study in. The school should reopen in a week or two. Sanitation is still a issue. They know how to be sanitary but the earthquake had also damaged all the outhouses.  We only saw 2 working outhouses while we were there.  They said that they had plans to rebuild more outhouses in the near future. This may be something that can be done to help in the future if it has not been done already. The main this that we saw and heard that they needed was dry shelter. Since most of the pieces were salvaged to build the temporary shelters, they have some holes in them. And with monsoon season almost here they are worried about staying dry. I think that a simple solution is to get some tarps to cover the roof and holes. Before the tarps can be put on the roofs, they need to make the area around the holes not sharp. Since they were all nailed down and when they were pulled or ripped off they have jagged edges. If this is not taken care of before they put on the tarp, the tarps will rip when the winds and rains come. The next best solution is to replace the roofs with new sheet metal.&quot;","Conflicting Information, Shelter, Zinc Sheets, ",27.762,85.196,9841657103,Dhading,,Ward,,,,,,,,,,Krishna Raj,Katel,,YES,YES,Actionable,NO,YES,YES,"&quot;I just got word that the CGI arrived yesterday, enough for more than 1000 dwellings!

The serious problem that is possible starvation and epidemic has been taken into consideration thus as relief package varieties of needy items has provided to all the households which may support to turn the difficult lives into a normal situation possibly soon, i hope so.The support what has been provided till the date was only for short term beneficial however the victims more importantly required the temporary shelter because rainy season approaching soon. it would be better to think on long term resilience and a temporary school house is urgently needed because after 10 days school class will be resumed as planed by government. Then a well structured school building should me made to ensure the educational rights of children as soon as possible. At finale i would like to thanks to all those helping hands and kind hearts through the calling efforts by BVS-Nepal. I am very much indebted to all of their efforts and hope more support to be continued.","Other, Shelter, ",27.83786,84.96621,9841054342,Dhading,,VDC,,,1,,,Dispatched,,KLL,,,,,YES,YES,Actionable,NO,NO,NO,Temporary shelter and schools needed ,"Needs category adjusted as there is no medical assistance needs.

There is a village named Apun that is in dire need of material assistance.  It is an area of 70 houses, almost all of which have been completely destroyed.  It is a population of around 330, half of which are children.
This is also an area that is not accessible by bus; it is approximately a three hour hike from Bacheck (route:  Kharibot to Keprung to Apun).  Since the earthquake they have had not been visited by any other INGOs, and have had to transport what shelter and food goods they have from the city on their own.  
They are running out of food and are in need of staples such as rice and dal, as well as materials for shelters that can withstand the monsoon season such as tin, nails and bamboo.
Additionally, sanitary conditions are not ideal as most of their outdoor toilet structures have been destroyed, and they have no structured facility to cook food.
If there is a coordinated group of volunteers and/or an INGO that could come and assist Apun and its neighboring village of a similar size, they need all the help they can get.  I have left the contact information of a village member below, he is in Kathmandu this week.

Teaching faculty : 14 ( 5 women)
School students caste : 80% Tamang, 10% Dalit , 8% Chhetri and 2% Brahmin 
Damage area : 10 rooms includes school administration office and library
Details 
This school is located 35km from Panauti Bazaar. The school has no temporary shelter support and one entire block has been marked unsafe from the government. Demolishment of the unsafe building can only be done by government official or only if the school receives letter to demolish from government. 
School cannot demolish the unsafe building without informing the DEO . If the unsafe building gets demolished there would be space to build temporary shelter in the current school location, but than this would take time and with monsoon we have limited time

Problem :
The school has very limited school property which is hindering setting up a temporary shelter. The only possible way to setup a temporary shelter is the school gets another community land. For this the school has said they would take the lead and responsibility to find a community land as soon as possible. 
The school also has a newly constructed building which also has been damaged by the earthquake. Yet the students are residing in this unsafe new building and teachers are currently taking classes. 

What can be done :
Setting up temporary shelter is the foremost priority. Temporary shelter with atleast 8 different rooms will be ideal. Setting up temporary shelter space needs to be identified by the school.

School library books
Science lab materials

Everyone is currently sleeping outside their homes, but many are camped in places under risk of landslides, which claimed the life of the only fatal victim in the village. They have received small tarps and some have bought tin sheets with their personal finances to build flimsy shelters, which are generally too small to lodge medium to large sized families and not suited for daily activities. Most spend their days in what was left of their damaged houses. The health post has only one room still standing, which is still being used. We could state that particularly the large families are far from being sufficiently sheltered for the monsoon. I was shocked to witness that there were people sleeping with buffaloes, alongside feces, due to the lack of space.

According to the social mobilizer and to the other residents we talked to, they have a stock of food that should last about three weeks only. Though some continued to tend to their crops, several fields were buried by landslides and 60 to 70 livestock are reported to have been killed. Though part of the community is working daily, Chandanpur is yet another case of a village that has lost most of its musclepower to migrant labor.

The relief priorities they requested is material for building shelters and 'dry' food to last the monsoon, and it seems absolutely reasonable.","Medical Facility, Camp, Shelter Organization, Other, ",27.666667,85.316667,9808 166073,Okhaldhunga,,Ward,,5,5,,,,,KLL,,Lena,Tosta,lenatosta@yahoo.co.in,YES,YES,Actionable,YES,NO,NO,,"Talked to Bijay ji, as per him people are in need of food stuffs, zinc sheets for about 250 houses and drinking water.",6/19/2015 12:29

It was established on January 23rd, 1961 and registered with the District Education Office,Kathmandu. The school has 45 students of age 4 to 11 years’ old and follows HSEB as its curriculum of academic study. They have a single floor 4 roomed school building based on a 2759.4 sq. ft. (8 anna 1 Paisa). The building occupies 30 by 60 ft of the total space.  This primary school has class nursery to class five.
Although the school is very old, It is a sad fact that they follow a practice of multi class system, i.e. grade nursery and grade 1st students study in the same class simultaneously due to lack of space . Similarly, grade 2nd students and grade 3rd students, and grade 4th students and grade 5th students study together.  There is a single teacher teaching these two levels of students with split hour of the class period, i.e. 22 minutes per each grade of student in a 45 minute period.
After the earthquake of 25th April 2015, the school suffered serious damage and their one and only study building, built in 2009 by the permission of district education office and now has been marked unsafe by the inspecting officials. Although the building is made of concrete, almost all of the inner walls of the building has cracks and looks vulnerable. Similarly the roof which is made up of steel and iron support has created cracks on the wall at the joint. The roof could fall anytime.  
Now the government has asked the schools to reopen and conduct classes. The school principal, mr. Badri Prasad exclaims that the faculties are also scared to go inside the school, leave alone the kids. He shows concern about how they could conduct classes now, when the situation is worsened. 
Following this talk with Mr. Badri, we have come to know that the school requires immediate rehabilitation by providing temporary shelters where the classes could go on. We also feel an urgent need to reconstruct a two storey or more, earthquake resistant buildings so that the students have individual classes for every grade. The school lacks space and that has to be looked after by the government to relocate or to buy more lands for recreational activities of the students.
On our part, we have planned to help in rehabilitation and reconstruction of the entire school. We have planned to divide the project into two phase. Phase 1 is rehabilitation where we will construction tented classrooms; we will also look after the nutrition of students. In the second phase, we will construct the new school building using the sustainable resources and finally will hand over the school building to the school authorities.
I would be very humbled and joyful if you could help us in this project. I have hereby attached few photos of the school. Thank you.

Currently these families are surving on 15kg of rice that was distributed shortly after the earthquake, but this will soon run out.

All of these families need food supplies until they are able to provide for themselves. In August they will harvest corn and in September they can harvest rice.

I am asking if any organisations if they could help these families with food just until the families they can provide for themselves, please contact me.

&quot;I am Raksha, a doctor working at Namche clinic. 
As you know that after the earthquakes in Nepal, people have lost lives, shelters and properties and have ever since been living in fear. 

Remote villages in Nepal are facing huge challenges and are in dire need of aid. Among such villages are Thame, Khunde, Khumjung and many more that are north of Solukhumbu. These villages are yet to see any relief aids from the government and many have lost hope that there will be any. We are glad to see the local community get united and help each other in such time.

The earthquake has left most of the houses inhabitable and villagers have taken shelter in makeshift tents. This had led to people catching flu, respiratory infection, diarrhea diseases at a very fast pace. We fear that unhygienic and crowded living conditions with extreme weather will soon invite even more diseases.

Due to the extreme weather condition that people have to face everyday, everyone is looking forward to rebuild their homes as soon as possible which is very difficult considering the scarcity of home builders and carpenters right now. We presume it will take months to years before there will be any semblance to normalcy here. 

People did call me they would help bring aid here but they never called back nor did they bring any help. 

**(May 26 2015)
According to Rakshya, the relief mentioned by CDO is not provided yet.There is 60- 70 household in each V.D.C. Relief materials are distributed by Private organizations and gumba but its not evenly distributed. Most of the upper villages like Khunde, Khumjung, Bhorpse, Khawa etc. have received tarps but not food stuffs yet. Some foriegner provided some tea and biscuits to selective needy people.Sanitary need ( Sanitizer, soaps, toilet paper, Bucket tap) is mentioned. Its raining, snowing and storming there. Although tents are distributed following needs are mentioned as well(for rebuilding):- 1. Zinc roofs 2. Cement 3. Labour/ volunteer to build temporary house. 4. Safety helmet (rubble clearing)

Please let me know if there can be any help from your side. You can reach me at raksha.shres@gmail.com

Immediate Need In:
Ghyalchowk – 4, Benigaun
Darbung – 8, Rampur
Estimated Population: 65 households in Benigaun, 80 households in Rampur
Almost no relief has reached thes
e places due to geographical inaccessibility. Only 2 or 3 trucks go to these places, and its an extremely dangerous road. The estimated time to reach is 3 hours by road, or 3 to 4 hours walking. One round trip from Benighat to Benigaun costs 8500 – 9000. The trucks have a capacity of upto 3.5 tonnes. Usually, these trucks go once a month to deliver supplies to a local businessman in Benigaun. Other drivers without experience will not be able to drive here. The people usually walk, so there is no need for regular transportation to and from that place. On the way to Benigaun is Rampur, which also has not received aid. Covering both locations at once would be ideal. Only 3 trucks travel to this place. One round trip costs 8500 Nrp and has a capacity of 3,5 tonnes. Going again and again is not possible. Food and shelter required. &quot;	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","VDC Trip Summaries, ",27.814895,84.740856,9851148684,Gorkha,,Ward,,1,1,,,,,KLL,,,,,YES,YES,Actionable,YES,NO,NO,,Tapailai call garda lagana plz yo sms  paya paxi call garnu hola thankyou.,6/17/2015 10:47

1777,Relief Unreachable - Gorkha Far-West,5/10/2015 10:34,Gorkha far west,"Dear All,
This is to kindly inform you all that in the far west region of Gorkha, due to the landslide the roads(kaccha) also have seems to be destroyed completely, taking away more than 150 Donkeys death, which use to carry loads to reach up the mountain, near the lake.
Today is the fifteenth day and currently there is no source of way to reach up there, except for the expert climbers. It is sad to tell you all that the local people in that zone who we met told me that the locals there have all started feeling that they belongs to no one’s lands, as time has passed and they are just left haphazardly with no source of basic relief until now.
I do not know how to put up this word correctly but I have this strong feeling that the leaders of the country who are leading are playing with the sentiments of the civilians right now, be it you me or any.
It is of a big surprise to me that how it is even possible for the government to charge one and half lakh to two and half lakhs, of rupees for delivering the relief material to anyone interested at that particular zone?  Where else the relief material that only fits in the helicopters are worth not even more than fifty to sixty thousand rupees only, is a question to me.
This is not the time to do business is how I think. Either we have forgotten our rights to public property else the government has forgotten it’s the public’s property.
Finally, after the fifteenth day the Secretary of the wards that you will see in the video(First left hand side of the screen is Dhurbaraj Parajuli, a Secretary of Keranju, VDC-9) is moving today along with other EIGHTY SEVEN i.e. 9th May. Where else when I tried to reach out to the CDO of Gorkha district, his cell phone was switched
.  Eventually I consider this INHUMAN!!!!
I, would kindly request you all to appeal in this regard as many of our brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers are all crying out loud for help and we think should also think outside the box as I am sharing the correct information if you all are not informed well, that there has been no relief material properly sent there .
Let us all help!!!!!
Here is some collective information please kindly get an idea how to reach there. 
Most importantly we should ask for free service
P.S. I do not recommend anyone to go hiking there with the relief material as we were told that it’s an unusual and awkward small thin ways where soil erosions are high, every day, along with 100 meters down there is a river flowing

1770,"Shelter &amp;amp; sanitation materials, volunteer engineers requested for 600 families",5/9/2015 17:43,katunjepuni,"Approximately 600 familiesfrom surrounding areas have gathered at 27.967582, 84.996893 following the earthquake. Through my volunteer work with StandbyTaskforce, I was initially in contact with them in the first week, as they sought food and medical assistance for their injured. Today, the english speaking man in their group (Uday Parattha Ph. +977 9849027000), contacted me again by phone to see if I could pass through a request for engineers and materials to help build shelter for their genuinely displaced people only.

So I believe that many of the initial 600 families have no shelter or sanitation. They are seeking plastic sheeting to make shelters from, and hopefully some engineers to help them prepare shelter and sanitaytion (toilet) facilities.

In the long term, they are interested in building a district centre combining public health and education, and hope some engineers may volunteer to help with that but right now they are seeking seom materials and volunteer engineer help with sanitation facilities and shelter for their displaced families.

I tried calling Uday again, while filing this request, to get a better understanding of how many people require shelter but I could not get through.

I am reporting this from Australia - my name is Alistair Hart (+61 409 885 776 - alistair@mangoesmapping.com.au). I was helping with SBTF prior to our being stood down when we handed over our data to KLL. That is why this man Unday has contacted me,as I've been managing his initial request when we were active.

NB. I could not find a location name for this village and cannot locate my original request in the SBTF google sheets, so the Location name I have used is the closest I could find in Google Earth. Katunjepuni the location I have nominated is ~6-7KM west of the actual location of the families requiring shelter.","Other, Water Sanitation and Hygiene, Shelter, ",27.967442,84.998408,9849027000,Dhading,,Exact location,,,,,,,,KLL,,Alistair,Hart,alistair@mangoesmapping.com.au,YES,YES,Actionable,NO,YES,NO,"Contacted Uday Parattha who with his friends ran a relief program in Dhading for a week.Mainly in ward no 1,2,3.

We had no place to land the chopper so we hovered 30 ft in air, opened the chopper door in high wind and rain and threw food out the door to them. It was scary and risky but worth every effort.

They need evacuation. This supply likely will last them only a few days.

We barely just put a band aid on a bleeding jugular. This village is 15 minutes flight from KTM airport. 
Gokul Thapa is my hero who risked his life to save these people. I was holding him while he threw 30 kg bags of rice out the door. I don't need your money , I need your voice call, you congressman call your media. The world needs to know.

This is an appeal to support the earthquake victims of Bungkot VDC Ward No. 4, Gorkha, Nepal. A 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal on 25th April, 2015 have obliged affected peoples live in the open fields and barren land and under the open sky too in some case though 14th day of such devastating quake had already passed.

Food and medical supplies are running quite low that too with insufficient reliefs while risks are looming large for the health epidemic as a result of temporary open shelters and unhygienic food. More than 95% of the houses (total of about 120 houses) in this area are damaged ( completely damaged houses about 90 %). With the monsoon season imminent, the need for shelter is increasing.  

I, Pradeep Parajuli, an engineering student from Kathmandu University, had personally visited this VDC yesterday (dated 7th May, 2015) with stuffs I can carry and distributed it to 3 nearby houses and help them in excavation too. I had taken photographs showing the destruction of houses, temporary settlements, tents limitation.

Herein is attached the photographs showing the miserable condition of the whole VDC. Your rescue team is doing quite good. I would be grateful if your rescue team could do something for that VDC too.

So far we've sent supplies to village in Dolakha and Melamchi near Helambu region. We could really use your help to figure out where the help is needed the most. We've heard reports saying there are people starving in Gatlang which we are trying to figure out how to get to. Can we combine our efforts? Do you guys have more volunteers in Kathmandu that you can connect us with that can help our ground team with the relief efforts?

E 84 59.235
Whole village dispersed, approx. 700 people now living in 4 new tent villages close together. 
Water: Main issue is that the water source is a half hour walk away across a landslide. Therefore specific request is for 3km length of 32mm diamter piping &amp;amp; 1x 15kg bag of cement to channel water to new location (ideally by helicopter).
Sanitation is not being handled well so concerns over the water source are high. Failing this, perhaps large water containers could be dropped or at least large quantities of hand sanitizer - soap is irrelevant at this time. 
Also required; blankets and clothing as there are currently none.
Medical status: there are no critical injuries but widespread diarrhoea, hacking cough and infected small wounds. There is a trainee medical practitioner to whom we have given our medical supplies. His contact details; Ramesh Tamang 9741273827. He is requesting more bandages, suture sets, pain killers, diarrhoea medicine etc. as his clinic was completely destroyed. 

We have managed to arrange privately a small helicopter to land in Sattyadevi to airlift out 2 injured people. This is happening 5/5 and at the same time some food and additional medicine (focussing on diarrhoea) will be dropped to be shared with this village cluster in Ree VDC.

Additional information; the team just (2pm May 5th) witnessed an army helicopter landed today down hill from Ree village (coordinates above) but within Ree VDC at a new school building (probably known landmark) 10 army personnel handing out supplies.","VDC Trip Summaries, Medical Assiatance, Water Sanitation and Hygiene, Shelter, ",28.11,84.97,9813539769,Dhading,,Exact location,,,,,,,,KLL,,Jessica,Stanford,jessica_stanford@yahoo.co.uk,YES,YES,Actionable,NO,YES,NO,"According to report 2465, Shelter and food security needs have been met for this VDC. http://www.quakemap.org/reports/view/2465","OCHA mulyankan samuha le yo chhetra ko adhyaodhik jankari dinu huna ka lagi anurodha gareko cha.

Village: Sangachok

Nepal
Date of visit: 04/05/2015
Estimated population: around 7000
Damage on buildings: 90 % of houses collapsed, 10 % with major cracks and unsuitable for living inside
Transport and accessibility: Cars and buses can access the village, but there have been many landslides on the way and due to the continuous aftershocks, there is a risk of blockage of the roads. The landscape of the village is very hilly with variation of altitudes across the whole area, which has caused blockage of pathways, covered with rubble. The access to the main road is difficult.
Aid presence: So far only the organisation Save the children has reached with help to the settlement, delivering food and providing medical support. Most of the supplies could not reach the village, since they have been taken and utilized by the villages at lower altitude.
Shelter: 100 % of people live outside, around 10 % sleep in tents or under plastic sheets
Food: 50 % of people have food supply for about a week, 50 % less than a week
Drinking water: Local source, but shortage reported
No report for conflicts and aggression so far.

1462,Earthquake Assessment Report | Gati &amp;amp; Ghumthang VDC - Sindupalchowk,5/4/2015 22:52,Gati Sindupalchowk,"01st May 2015 | Namaste Nepal
Villages Assessed / Being Assessed
Gati, Dandakateri, Nakuche, Samasadhu, Mandra and Sotang.
Location on Strava - https://www.strava.com/activities/297713765
Gati - 112 Households
Damage - Only three structures standing (Kindergarten, a hollow brick house, and part of the secondary school)
Deaths - 4
The trail leading to Gati is shredded, and there are open gash landslides. The agricultural road access has been damaged by landslide or rocks standing on the way. The water taps are suddenly full of water (looks like a new acquifer has joined with the original source)
Dandakateri - 78 Households
Damage - Only three houses standing (hollow brick houses)
Deaths - 3
The trail leading to Dandakateri is damaged and shredded. The ancient trail to Tibet connecting Dandakateri and Gati is dangerous as there are rocks hanging out from the recent landslides caused by the earthquake. The water dried out here, but the locals have braved the conditions and re-connected the pipes, so water is back on. The spring water is a bit sour (sulphur?)
Reports still coming in from Mandra, Sotang, Nakuche and Samasadu. Teams were there on recce on the 01st and 02nd of May.
This will expand the coverage of this report to about 1000 households, but only covers 6 wards of the two VDC’s which have a total of 18 wards. This is the immediate working area of Namaste Nepal, but relief might have to be expanded to cover the two VDC’s, which will take the total to about 3000 households.
They are bringing back list of households, the damage report, the death toll, the number of children below 10 and the number of children below 5.
——
Two board members of Namaste Nepal are from this village. Mohan Shrestha and Ramesh Lama, both of whom have lost their houses.
Adaptation: The villagers in this area are constructing temporary shelters from wood and tin salvaged from their broken down houses, and using bamboo and some agricultural plastic or tarp or tin. Some have even used the slate that was on the roof as flooring material. Some are sleeping on straw.
The dead have been cremated and the animals buried. The villagers are extremely busy building their medium term shelters
Emergency Relief Priorities
Tarp
Rice and Lentils and supplemental food supplies
Mid Term Priorities (though best to go in straight away)
Temporary toilets
Water Tests
Temporary school
Temporary Health Post with supplies
Temporary gathering space for meetings for village level decisions
Methodology:
In a discussion with the Board of Namaste Nepal, these were the decisions made locally
The emergency relief supplies would be controlled by the Youth Groups - a leader has already been formed, and the base for this will be the Borderlands Resort, which is connected by road.
Lists of all households will be used to ensure there is no duplicacy
In case of shortages of supplies, women with children, marginalised groups will be prioritised. 
NOTE: And example of this was already in practice. As we reached with low supplies, the youth group immediately decided in favour of marginalised groups and the Dalits got the first priority in this area. After that, the rest was kept in storage awaiting better supplies, in order to maintain social harmony.
An information board has been set up at Borderlands for Rescue teams, international aid coming in, and help groups coming in that area - outlining who all has already reached there, and trying to collate what they learnt in order to avoid duplicacy.
Challenges
Safety. The area is still very fragile and the tremors are felt more than in other places. There is a chance that some landslides will happen, specially if it rains
Pilferage. Reaching Gati needs going via the Dolalghat - Barabise stretch where some looting has happened of goods going in. Police protection is required. We thought of bringing in locals when the supplies are ready.
Communications. Only when reaching higher grounds there is some cellphone reception. This could improve over time.
Dependency. The help that is given should be supporting the priorities each village is taking in the relief and rebuilding process, and should not feed into the Dependency Syndrome that aid brings.","Building Collapsed, Road Damaged, Medical Assiatance, Food, Water Sanitation and Hygiene, Shelter, ",27.83739,85.8983,,Sindhupalchok,,VDC,,,,,,,,KLL,,Raj,Gyawali,raj@socialtours.com,YES,NO,Actionable,NO,NO,NO,,OCHA mulyankan samuha le yo chhetra ko adhyaodhik jankari dinu huna ka lagi anurodha gareko cha.

From Kimtang VDC, heavily affected VDCs of northern Dhading, Satyadevi and Darkha, are accessible on foot. The distance from Trisuli to Kimtang VDC is 35 km. (Kathmandu-Trisuli is 85 km by paved road in good condition.)

·         Dolakha: the main road via Khadichaur, Sindhupalchowk, Mude, Charikot and Mainapokhari to Jiri is open.

We were the first people there. All the people were traumatized, we witnessed multiple injuries, very poor hygiene conditions (lack of water, no spare cloting, barefoot), lack of food, water, electricity (-&amp;gt; no communication possible).

Immediate requirements:
- Recovery and sanitation of dead livestock &amp;amp; human corpses (dozens of bodies burried under debris in Asi Kilo)
- Landslides: villagers and rescue are at high risk: the ground is cracked and might just fall in at any time and/or cause landslides at the first (monsoon)rains.
- Water quality tests
- Sanitation and water
- Electricity
- Considering the water situation, a lot of people are prone to diarrea, cholera etc in the coming weeks.
- Volunteer labor and technology to rebuild the houses
- The aid we saw on the 29th was only on the main road (Turkish org distributing food + Medical assistance)
- Not much is going up, apart from some rice bags.
- Villagers told us the VDCs bought rice with the money normally allocated to build their road.

IMPORTANT: Volunteers going up there should be very fit.

Immediate needs:
- 500 tarps (one per family, and fitting 10 people)
- 5000 blankets (fleece)
- 2000 meters rope (cheap plastic thin rope + nepali jute dohai)
- 2500 slippers (adult and children)
- 1000-2000 clothes soap
- 1000-2000 dettol soap
- clean fabric for menstruation

MEDICAL DETAILS:
Most wounds were easily treatable with
- Betadine
- Gauze, cotton
- antibiotic ointment/tabs/caps
- bandages
- plaster casts
- pain medicine (tabs, syrup, topical gel)
- sterile water
- normal saline
- ORS
- sterile gloves
- tetanus toxoid
- injections
- water purification
- hand sanitizers/soap
- masks

MEDICAL REPORT:
over 100 people treated
major conditions:
- head trauma
- wound infections
- sore throats
- fever
- diarrhea
- blunt trauma with multiple small wounds
- new cuts from repairing houses
- referred emergency cases to the &quot;&quot;nearby&quot;&quot; free health care
ADVICE: follow up needed for the wound infections
Possibility of major epidemic due to lack of clean water and sanitation&quot;	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","VDC Trip Summaries, ",27.77,85.84,9803281686,Other,,VDC,,,,,,,,,,,,,YES,NO,Unactionable,NO,NO,NO,,,

Luckily, my mother, brother, sister-in law and sister survived. 

We lost all properties of our birthplace .  I am keeping myself busy in counselling my family members……..as they cry at times…
 
The government has not been able to supply essential items to the earthquake victims to the Kavrepalanchowk district, only a few places are being covered. Dispute between the political parties have also affected to smooth supply of needy goods. 

There has been a lot of complaints from the public. I had also complained to the home ministry, district headquarters, prime Minister office…but administration is very slow...
 
As per my consultation with other village colleagues, 100 per cent houses are damaged/all are homeless. All rescue efforts are being done on the initiatives of individuals/institutions. An estimated of 311 have been declared dead in the district.
 
In my area, 5 people died due to earthquake. A total of estimated 1050 families got affected and 200 houses collapsed. Only a few number of people have been able to recover food-grains from their houses. 
 
If possible, we need to supply some very essential goods to the victims in that areas such as mattress (200), 200 sacks of rice, among others. Tents does not seem to be a problem now as these items are being supplied by individuals/institutions as well. We have to make a team in the areas with local participation and handover.

According to him, each family are provided with 5-10 and 10-15 kg of food which is not sufficient for them and the tents house is badly affected by heavy storm. So, he requested to provide tent for 85 families including food.

In the wake of the recent earthquake in Nepal and its severe impact in Sindhupalchowk, there have been a number of NGOs, informal organisations, individuals and the Nepalese government working to provide basic relief aid to a number of VDCs. However, as these efforts have not been coordinated and as no supply chain has been established as of yet, our efforts have not been effective and aid has not been distributed in an equitable manner. Many villages, where there is no road access, for instance have not received any support and this is causing local anger, tension and is hampering the aid delivery and distribution process. 
In order to address this and to support the work undertaken by the many organisations and individuals, Clean up Nepal is undertaking a district-wide survey of the open shelters and number of people at each shelter in order to create a database that will assist organisations to contribute to needs more effectively.

We are seeking 200 proactive, independent and self-motivated individuals to collect this data at different VDCs of Sindhupalchowk tomorrow on the 3rd of May 2015. As many of these VDCs are not accessible by bus, we will require at least 100 individuals to have their own mode of transport, i.e. bikes. Data collection will take place in pairs and each pair will be required to collect data from one VDC. There are 79 VDCs in Sindhupalchowk. Most VDCs are accessible by bike.

An orientation will be held at the Clean up Nepal office in Minbhawan tomorrow on 03 May 2015 at 8am. The location map for the Clean up Nepal office can be found at: http://cleanupnepal.org.np/contact-us/. For more information, please contact Neelam Pradhananga on neelam_pradhananga@yahoo.com and Yam Karki on 9851 172 357. For URGENT inquiries only, please sms Neelam on 9808 211 827 with your inquiry and she will get back to you.

There was a district-level committee meeting yesterday in Simikot, where representatives from all areas of Humla were in attendance. The official word is that no casualties resulted in Humla District as a results of the earthquake, and as far as everyone can tell, there has been no structural damage. Rockfall and landslides, however, do continue to persist, especially in Upper Humla (in the area between Simikot and the China/Tibet border). This winter was very harsh in Humla - snow continues to fall in the villages above 12,000ft. Since the earthquake, everyone here has been on high alert, and travel between villages is being kept to bare necessity.

1744,"Brief Report on Visit to Budepa, Karthali VDC in Sindhupalchowk – Summary and Recommendation for future programs",5/1/2015 9:15,"Karthali, Bagmati, Central Region, Nepal","On May 1st, a team of 6 doctors visited Budepa village of Karthali VDC ward # 5 where a Health Post is located. This was one of the 4 hard hit areas as per the DHO. We took a bus to Simle village of Karthali VDC and then walked for 2 hours to reach Budepa Health Post. We also stopped at the Palate village of Barhabish VDC. We spoke to local people, community leaders and government health personnel regarding the situation of the VDC.

Physical impact
The area has been devastated.
-	Many houses (mostly non-concrete) have been razed to the ground. Even those that are standing have large cracks and are uninhabitable.
-	The road had many cracks but were motorable. A large landslide about 45 minutes’ walk from Simle VDC had cut off the road.
-	The new building of the Health post at Budepa was intact with minor cracks along the wall. The ground along the entrance of the health post had numerous large cracks, but was still walkable. The building of the Palate sub-health post is partially damaged.
-	Schools were badly damaged and can’t be used without complete reconstruction.

Human Impact

Medical:
During our one day health camp, we examined 121 patients of which less than 10 were directly affected by earthquake. Most were musculoskeletal pain and cut injury requiring dressing. One lady with both bone fracture of leg on her way to KTM, was splinted and given analgesics.

Housing:
Due to frequent aftershocks and damaged houses, all were sleeping outdoors under the tarpaulin or under lean-tos made of bamboo and corrugated tins. During the initial days of the earthquake, families shared shelters and ate in community mess. But now families are either living alone or a few related neighboring families were sharing the shelter and kitchen.
Groups of neighbors have started taking turns salvaging the remaining household appliances and housing materials from damaged homes.

Food:
The food stores have been buried under the rubble. As the intensity of aftershocks were decreasing, families have started removing the rubble for food. Also neighbors have been helping each other with food. 

Water/Sanitation:
The water sources were still intact and no pollution was reported. So, people are still drinking directly from the source. 
Toilets have been extensively damaged and due to ongoing aftershocks, people are defecating outdoors. 
Cattles and chicken crushed under the houses have started giving out foul smells.

Relief Response

Government:
-	No government relief response was noted.

Non-governmental:
-	We saw one group distributing sacks of rice to people of certain VDCs, which was, according to community leaders, the first relief program.
-	Ours was the only medical relief till then.
-	Delivery of relief material was made difficult by the inaccessibility of road, and difficulty in transporting the relief material. 
-	Pre-visit coordination with local community leaders and activists made the conduction of this visit smooth.

Summary and Recommendations
Sindhupalchowk has sustained massive destruction to its houses and infrastructure. The aftershocks are ongoing and transporting relief materials to remote places is very difficult. We recommend involvement of VDC secretary and All-party committee for any relief operation to ensure unbiased distribution.

The immediate needs are:
1.	Temporary housing that can last at least 6 months. It should be able to provide protection from upcoming monsoon. Also provision for temporary toilet should be made.
2.	At this phase, the local health facilities are able to provide the necessary medical relief. So, effort should be made to replenish their supplies. Also, the reporting of any outbreaks should be emphasized. Medical camps to provide primary care will produce too little output.
3.	Temporary housing for schools should be made a priority. The schools should be made the main focal point for hygiene, sanitation and epidemic prevention. This can be done by ensuring regular supply of soaps, ‘piyush’ and ORS to students to take to their families.

Long-term needs:
1.	Rebuilding the road.
2.	Long term permanent housing solutions.
3.	Rebuilding of schools.

People remain at other places in Rasuwa, such as Dhunche, Syaphru Besi, and Thuman VDC. Most roads in the area are not motorable or passable, but several individuals have reported that the main road south from Dhunche is passable on foot (obstructed by rockfall, but with no new large landslides - amazingly). Evacuation efforts can thus be conducted from the Kalikasthan/Ramche area, above Betrawati via vehicle - the road is reported clear from Betrawati to Kathmandu.

Devastation of local villages and agricultural lands in the district of Rasuwa remain severe. And casualties in the Langtang valley are estimated near 300.

This is from a FB post (sad sad one) of Sashank of a remote village in Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal.

My home is Sindhupalchowk, and I am from remote VDC Selang-9. My home and my village is completely destroyed. I have walked three hours this evening down to nearby Jalbire town. I had come to this nearby town hoping to meet some relief workers, but until now I am yet to meet anyone. I could access Facebook in Jalbire. I could not access the NTC and NCELL network. Sky (network) used to exist, but has ceased to work after earthquake.

Not a bit of chau-chau (ramen noodles) and biscuit has reached my village yet. I learned from Facebook that most think of Sankhu, Melamchi, Chautara and Barabise when they think of Sindhupalchowk. Sindhupalchowk is very remote, with 70-80 village development committees. This earthquake has destroyed the whole of Sindhupalchowk. 99% of it. Among my relatives in my village, 15 have died. This death may not even be counted or acted upon. If the rescue team goes to all villages and counts the death tool, there will most likely be 5-6 thousands in Sindhupalchowk alone. So many more are still unknown. Rescue teams have reached neither in our village, nor other 100-200 villages. We dug out many dead bodies through mutual help. Still many remain. Lots of animals have died, and it is beginning to stink. To reach my home, you have to walk further 25 kilometers from the Arniko highway. I know that there are many other villages that can be reached by over one day’s trek from my village. If nothing has reached my village, you can imagine if anything has reached in other villages.

I do not know why I am posting all this. There is a healthpost near my village. I know that people from villages located one days’ walk from my village come to this health post to get cetamol (popular painkiller in Nepal). I am not expecting that the villages that have not yet seen cetamol during all these years will see rescue teams.

Still I will be grateful if someone reads this post and tells the concerned agencies that Sindhupalchowk is big and remote. I will be truly grateful if someone takes initiative to ensure that supports are not limited to Sankhu and Melamchi, but all 70 VDCs including to our village.

Hello again Bijaya:

I am writing these notes you requested on behalf of Mr. Lotte Lama - a former resident of Upper Tsum Valley in the village of Chhokang Paro.  He asked me to send you his report.  These notes are in hopes of your facilitation of much needed food to the three areas of Tsum.  Nubri, Lower and Upper Tsum.  Lotte has heard from his sister who is a nun at Rachen Gompa near Burji.  The Gompa is easy to see from the air.  It has a red plaster and stone fence around the property.

1.  Barpak is approximately 30-40 miles from Chhokang Paro in Upper Tsum.  The trail to Tsum goes up the Budhi Gandaki and most likely completely unusable because of landslides. There are no roads into any part of Tsum. Helicopter is only way in now. 

2.  There are approximately 10-11,000 people in all of Tsum Valley.

3.  The people are in desperate need of food.  Rice, wheat, noodles, cooking oil and vegetables are important.

There were water taps in the villages and we don't know if they are still working.  There is a river through the main valley for Upper and Lower Tsum for water supplies.

4. They request warm clothes for babies, kids and adults.  The Upper Tsum sits at about 10,000 ft (over 3,000 meters).  It is very cold there right now.

5.  Chhokang Paro seems to be the hardest hit by the quake.  We know the village of Chhokang Paro is completely leveled. No structures exist now.  Unfortunately the grain and food for humans and livestock in mixed into the mess of rocks, timbers and water - and completely lost.  This is a huge humanitarian crisis as there is no way to resupply these residents by land. 
It is reported there is less structural damage as one goes up the valley toward Mu Gompa.

6.  In Lower Tsum - Ripchet had a substantial fire in the village.  There might be injuries there.  We don't know. We have not heard from Chumling. The trail is blocked. There is no electricity or communication in the valley.

7.  Nubri is to the west of these areas of Tsum and we don't know what has happened there.  Tsum residents have not been able to communicate with them. But it is similar to Lower and Upper Tsum - and very hard to travel there. There is a major monastery at Surang Gompa nearish to Nubri.  We don't know how they fared in the quake.

8.  In Upper Tsum there are plenty of open fields to land an helicopter...near Chhokang Paro.  There are fields to the immediate south of Ripchet in which to land.  There is a new trekkers' lodge at Burji and a field just to the immediate north for landing.  If the copter goes over a Mr. Dhawa Lama will probably come out to direct the copter to a landing spot.  There is a grassy field behind his lodge.  He is there now with some French trekkers.

9.  There is a nun at Domje in Lower Tsum who is trained as a dentist and doctor. She might be a big help if she can be contacted and given medical supplies.","Blocked Roads, Medical Assiatance, Food, Shelter, ",28.58,85.12,-5188,Gorkha,,Region,,3,2,Routed,,,,KLL,,Ron,Ranson,rranson@ucsd.edu,YES,YES,Actionable,YES,NO,YES,Spoke to Mr. Wangchook ji.

If you wish to talk to me, my number is 9818673545, 

In Bungamati there are 1200 families (4000-6000 people)displaced.

NEEDS: sufficient shelter for them to be comfortable whilst they rebuild their homes. At present there are some tents and plastic sheeting, but conditions are cramped. More shelter needed.

TOILETS: Displaced people do not have access to toilets and are defecating in the open, presenting serious health risks. LATRINES ARE A PRIORITY.

WATER: There is water in the communal tanks which is being refilled by tanker, however it is being used faster than it is being replenished.

RUBBLE CLEARING: There is significant damage to many buildings in Bungamati,and people lack tools and equipment to clear the rubble. 

They report they are ok for food and medicine at present, but could do with more clothes (especially children).

They also report that most of contributions have come from individual donations, rather than government or aid support. 

It is thought there is no one trapped in the rubble, but this is unconfirmed.

The assistant at the clinic is Debaki and her phone number is 9808513731 but her battery is very low. Another number is Pradam Bahadur Ghale 9849185980 and another is Ram Bahadur Ghale 9816627276. I know this is a long shot but these people are still alive and need help. Others in surrounding area who know of the clinic will undoubtedly be heading there for medical assistance if they are able.

Although the main building of the clinic was destroyed, we believe that another section, containing medical supplies and some shelter is still intact. More importantly, the clinic is staffed by a physicians assistant and former army medic, who have escaped injury and are helping local residents. There is also an open level area (unusual for this area) that we believe is suitable as a helicopter landing zone.

Approximately 7,000 people, many elderly and children live in the Baseri region and it is the northern most settlement in that section of Nepal, approximately 25 miles from the epicenter. People seeking medical care will likely go to the clinic and we believe it could serve as a valuable staging area for medical assistance.

272,Carnage at Langtang,4/29/2015 10:53,"Langtang, Rasuwa, Bagmati, Central Development Region, Nepal","Some information about the effects of the earthquake in the Langtang Valley, as well as the rest of Rasuwa:
 
 The village of Langtang was the site of the largest single catastrophe, as the entirety of village was completely buried by an avalanche that came from thousands of feet above on the southern slopes of Langtang Lirung and Langtang II. Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu were also buried. It is impossible to determine exactly how many people died there, but the estimate is perhaps over 300 people in total. The handful of survivors, roughly twelve locals and two foreigners, walked down to Ghodatabela below after spending the night of the 25th in a cave - thus there is no one at Langtang itself. This avalanche is perhaps 2-3 kilometers wide, and is obstructing movement within the upper valley corridor. Currently two large groups are stranded above and below (due to several intensive and recurring landslides in the steep sections between Ghodatabela and Lama Hotel).
 
 Above, at Kyangjin Gompa, there were reportedly fewer casualties (perhaps 5-10) yet many injured. Most of the injured have been evacuated via helicopter and there is an army medic team in place. Yet, currently, the problem is one of food shortage and illness. I have heard that the majority of the settlement, including the gompa, is remarkably intact. There is a smaller group of about 30-40 at the settlement of Sindum, about 4km below Kyangjin and closer to Langtang. This group has excavated several bodies from the major avalanche zone. They have also evacuated many of the injured, but are facing severe food shortages and illness (hopefully remedied by Nepal Army reinforcements and supplies on the evening of the 27th. Above Kyangjin Gompa, there were several smaller groups and climbing teams exploring the Upper Langtang valley, in a very high avalanche risk zone – I do not have good information on these groups, so please contact the respective embassies to determine who has been accounted for and evacuated via Kyangjim. As of the evening of April 27th, there was perhaps  120-140 people remaining above Langtang who need to be evacuated.
 
 Below, at Ghodatabela (where I was located during the earthquake for roughly 55 hours following the event) several large landslides were triggered from all directions, the largest from perhaps 1,500 meters above just below the settlement, completely obstructing passage. The two guesthouses there were partially destroyed by large boulders, and the army checkpoint barracks collapsed during the earthquake. The night after the quake, there were two groups sleeping in separate fields by the river, keeping distance from ongoing landslides and rockfall that continued throughout the night. The first Nepal Army helicopter arrived at about 8:30am, which dropped a “medic team” and took the injured from the upper camp; the second helicopter took more from the upper camp, a chaotic mix of Nepalis and foreigners. The group from below then moved up to the Army checkpost to evacuate their injured, however, the Army helicopter never came back (we were told due to fuel shortage and/or weather – however the Army did not have a radio or phone, or any means of communicating). After these helicopters came, Nepali survivors arrived from above and below, carrying several injured – this was the group closest to the avalanche – yet, unfortunately, the Army had no way of communicating this to the rescue teams. This added a high level of uncertainty to hours of extreme grief, as Nepalis arriving from above and below realized the scale of their loss.
 
 24 hours after the slide, the Army then moved the group to a single location across the river, which proved to be the safest location. In the evening, a private helicopter (with limited seats) arrived to evacuate a group of three Nepalis, yet they were replaced with the five most injured Nepali children (thankfully, yet forcefully). After this, a few of us worked with the Nepal Army to establish a formal triage list, which was 25 Nepalis and 2 foreigners (one Dutch and one Italian) for the next large Army helicopter, which arrived the next morning.  We successfully loaded the sick onto the helicopter, with a few other family members accompanying them at roughly 10am on April 27th. The army helicopter did not come back again until 645pm, and in between a private helicopter (a single pilot who did seven trips that day singlehandedly, pro bono) took two small groups of 6 people from Ghodatabela. The loading of all these helicopters was a highly chaotic experience, owing to both fear and ineffective/confused management on behalf of the Army. Communication improved throughout, but fell apart during the most emotional moments. At Ghodatabela, there was originally roughly 65 foreigners and perhaps 110 Nepalis - as of the night of April 27th there were still about 40 foreigners and 60 Nepalis stranded there. My hope is that another helicopter has been coordinated for this morning (I will refrain from the time being from being overly critical of the helicopter evacuation system, there are pros and cons), yet I fear that many evacuation attempts were limited by the storm system that came this afternoon.
 As of April 28th, as the aftershocks/tremors and rockfall have largely subsided, I was told that a few groups have successfully traveled from Ghodatabela through Sherpagaun via the high trail to Syaphru Besi. This is good news for the remaining, yet this is highly risky.
 
 Elsewhere in Rasuwa, around Briddim and Lingling and in several places along the road from Dhunche to Betrawati, in places such as Grang and Ramche, the majority of houses collapsed. I am not sure of the casualties caused by structural collapse. The Dhunche road itself seemed passable from the air, as there are no new large slides (other than the existing monsoonal ones), but I was told by someone walking from Syaphru Besi to Kalikasthan that a member of their group had fallen to their death while travelling. Along the Trishuli River valley itself, there are other smaller landslides and reports of significant collapse at Mailung, Simle, and Archale. In Betrawati, Gerkhu, and Mhanegaun in bordering Nuwakot district several houses also collapsed, and there were casualties in all of these places.
 
 The current data on total casualties following the earthquake here in Nepal is approaching 4,500. However, this is probably an underestimate considering that the estimate for the entire district of Rasuwa is 250, and there are at least 300 dead in the area around the village of Langtang alone. Across the board, it is still very difficult to determine exactly what has occurred in remote areas off the road system, as communication is down. Considered in terms of the percentage of total population, my sense is that Rasuwa has likely the third highest rate of fatality, behind Sindhupalchowk (at the epicenter of the major aftershock) and Dhading (closer to the center of the earthquake). Again, Langtang is probably one of the greatest single tragedies of this earthquake.

This group likely includes large groups of citizens from Estonia and Germany, as per this list.

Helicopters have been bringing people to Dhunche today... I heard that at least one helicopter load (not sure of size) was evacuated this morning, and someone else also told me that a helicopter came to Syaphru Besi this morning. In both cases, people are now walking from Dhunche south down the road (which is more stable now as the aftershocks and weather have subsided) toward Betrawati &amp;amp; Trishuli where they should be able to find some kind of ground transport to KTM.

Importantly, the fact that they are being brought to Dhunche (and not Kathmandu) is a good thing overall - because it means that helicopters can run quicker laps up into the Langtang Valley or elsewhere in Rasuwa and get more people out faster.","People Trapped, Blocked Roads, ",28.112534,85.296315,,Rasuwa,,VDC,,,,,,,,,,Austin,Lord,,YES,NO,Actionable,NO,NO,NO,,Just a situation assessment I recommend report closure.,5/27/2015 13:07

205,Langtang Valley - focsued on Ghodtabela,4/28/2015 23:25,"Ghodatabela, Langtang","Some information about the effects of the earthquake in the Langtang Valley, as well as the rest of Rasuwa:

The village of Langtang was the site of the largest single catastrophe, as the entirety of village was completely buried by an avalanche that came from thousands of feet above on the southern slopes of Langtang Lirung and Langtang II. Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu were also buried. It is impossible to determine exactly how many people died there, but the estimate is perhaps over 300 people in total. The handful of survivors, roughly twelve locals and two foreigners, walked down to Ghodatabela below after spending the night of the 25th in a cave - thus there is no one at Langtang itself. This avalanche is perhaps 2-3 kilometers wide, and is obstructing movement within the upper valley corridor. Currently two large groups are stranded above and below (due to several intensive and recurring landslides in the steep sections between Ghodatabela and Lama Hotel).
Above, at Kyangjin Gompa, there were reportedly fewer casualties (perhaps 5-10) yet many injured. Most of the injured have been evacuated via helicopter and there is an army medic team in place. Yet, currently, the problem is one of food shortage and illness. I have heard that the majority of the settlement, including the gompa, is remarkably intact. There is a smaller group of about 30-40 at the settlement of Sindum, about 4km below Kyangjin and closer to Langtang. This group has excavated several bodies from the major avalanche zone. They have also evacuated many of the injured, but are facing severe food shortages and illness (hopefully remedied by Nepal Army reinforcements and supplies on the evening of the 27th. Above Kyangjin Gompa, there were several smaller groups and climbing teams exploring the Upper Langtang valley, in a very high avalanche risk zone – I do not have good information on these groups, so please contact the respective embassies to determine who has been accounted for and evacuated via Kyangjim. As of the evening of April 27th, there was perhaps  120-140 people remaining above Langtang who need to be evacuated.
Below, at Ghodatabela (where I was located during the earthquake for roughly 55 hours following the event) several large landslides were triggered from all directions, the largest from perhaps 1,500 meters above just below the settlement, completely obstructing passage. The two guesthouses there were partially destroyed by large boulders, and the army checkpoint barracks collapsed during the earthquake. The night after the quake, there were two groups sleeping in separate fields by the river, keeping distance from ongoing landslides and rockfall that continued throughout the night. The first Nepal Army helicopter arrived at about 8:30am, which dropped a “medic team” and took the injured from the upper camp; the second helicopter took more from the upper camp, a chaotic mix of Nepalis and foreigners. The group from below then moved up to the Army checkpost to evacuate their injured, however, the Army helicopter never came back (we were told due to fuel shortage and/or weather – however the Army did not have a radio or phone, or any means of communicating). After these helicopters came, Nepali survivors arrived from above and below, carrying several injured – this was the group closest to the avalanche – yet, unfortunately, the Army had no way of communicating this to the rescue teams. This added a high level of uncertainty to hours of extreme grief, as Nepalis arriving from above and below realized the scale of their loss.
24 hours after the slide, the Army then moved the group to a single location across the river, which proved to be the safest location. In the evening, a private helicopter (with limited seats) arrived to evacuate a group of three Nepalis, yet they were replaced with the five most injured Nepali children (thankfully, yet forcefully). After this, a few of us worked with the Nepal Army to establish a formal triage list, which was 25 Nepalis and 2 foreigners (one Dutch and one Italian) for the next large Army helicopter, which arrived the next morning.  We successfully loaded the sick onto the helicopter, with a few other family members accompanying them at roughly 10am on April 27th. The army helicopter did not come back again until 645pm, and in between a private helicopter (a single pilot who did seven trips that day singlehandedly, pro bono) took two small groups of 6 people from Ghodatabela. The loading of all these helicopters was a highly chaotic experience, owing to both fear and ineffective/confused management on behalf of the Army. Communication improved throughout, but fell apart during the most emotional moments. At Ghodatabela, there was originally roughly 65 foreigners and perhaps 110 Nepalis - as of the night of April 27th there were still about 40 foreigners and 60 Nepalis stranded there. My hope is that another helicopter has been coordinated for this morning (I will refrain from the time being from being overly critical of the helicopter evacuation system, there are pros and cons), yet I fear that many evacuation attempts were limited by the storm system that came this afternoon.
As of April 28th, as the aftershocks/tremors and rockfall have largely subsided, I was told that a few groups have successfully traveled from Ghodatabela through Sherpagaun via the high trail to Syaphru Besi. This is good news for the remaining, yet this is highly risky.
Elsewhere in Rasuwa, around Briddim and Lingling and in several places along the road from Dhunche to Betrawati, in places such as Grang and Ramche, the majority of houses collapsed. I am not sure of the casualties caused by structural collapse. The Dhunche road itself seemed passable from the air, as there are no new large slides (other than the existing monsoonal ones), but I was told by someone walking from Syaphru Besi to Kalikasthan that a member of their group had fallen to their death while travelling. Along the Trishuli River valley itself, there are other smaller landslides and reports of significant collapse at Mailung, Simle, and Archale. In Betrawati, Gerkhu, and Mhanegaun in bordering Nuwakot district several houses also collapsed, and there were casualties in all of these places.
The current data on total casualties following the earthquake here in Nepal is approaching 4,500. However, this is probably an underestimate considering that the estimate for the entire district of Rasuwa is 250, and there are at least 300 dead in the area around the village of Langtang alone. Across the board, it is still very difficult to determine exactly what has occurred in remote areas off the road system, as communication is down. Considered in terms of the percentage of total population, my sense is that Rasuwa has likely the third highest rate of fatality, behind Sindhupalchowk (at the epicenter of the major aftershock) and Dhading (closer to the center of the earthquake). Again, Langtang is probably one of the greatest single tragedies of this earthquake.

I just had a conversation with Babita Kushwaha working with Teach for Nepal. She came back yesterday from Sindhupalchowk, one of the worst affected districts but is neglected at the moment. Babita is traumatised that the kids she taught for one year are mostly dead now. She along with her colleagues even pulled out 40 bodies themselves including one of her own colleagues.
Does anyone know any organisations that can help in Sindhupalchowk’s Nawalpur village? The focus is on the main areas of Sindhupalchowk only. No organisations/relief is reaching Nawalpur as it is really a remote place. Urgent help is required.
Almost 80-90% houses are wiped out according to locals. The focus has been on Kathmandu and city areas but we cannot forget our brothers and sisters from these remote places. I know our security personnels from Nepal are doing as much as they can but we need to hurry up. Babita can be reached at 9841140634 and babita.k36@gmail.com.
We need all the necessary items for the people who survived and rescue people who are still trapped. The roads are still inaccessible but it might get better by the time we mobilise resources for the people.

We know the village of Chhokang Paro is completely leveled. No structures exist now.  Unfortunately the grain and food for humans and livestock in mixed into the mess of rocks, timbers and water - and completely lost.  This is a huge humanitarian crisis as there is no way to resupply these residents by land. In Upper Tsum there are plenty of open fields to land an helicopter...near Chhokang Paro.  There are fields to the immediate south of Ripchet in which to land.  Ripchet is one of the poorest places I have ever seen (Ron writing).   There is a new trekkers' lodge at Burji and a field just to the immediate north for landing.  If the copter goes over a Mr. Dhawa Lama will probably come out to direct the copter to a landing spot.  There is a grassy field behind his lodge.  He is there now with some French trekkers.
