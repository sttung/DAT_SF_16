I grew up in the Bay Area, but only recently moved back to the area since leaving to attend college outside Boston.
I studied Sociology & Anthropology while in college, then worked in education consulting on program evaluations for a few years before starting 
my MPA. After completing my program, I moved to Nairobi to work at a company running low-cost private schools.

I'm interested in learning about the different types of data tech companies here collect and analyze and which of these
approaches could be applied in emerging market contexts - especially to improve international development project design + 
monitoring & evaluation efforts.
